# Time-Series Anomaly Transformer

A specialized transformer architecture designed for multi-variate anomaly detection in high-frequency industrial sensor data.

## Model Description
- **Developed by:** David Fernandez
- **Model type:** Time-Series Transformer
- **License:** MIT

## Features
- Handles up to 32 simultaneous sensor streams.
- Self-attention mechanism captures long-range temporal dependencies in sensor patterns.
- Pre-trained on diverse industrial telemetry (pumps, compressors, motors).

## Evaluation
Validated on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) and custom industrial datasets with superior performance in detecting gradual drift and point anomalies.
