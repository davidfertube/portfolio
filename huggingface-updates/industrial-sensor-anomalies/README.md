# Industrial Sensor Anomalies

Multi-variate time-series dataset containing simulated sensor readings from complex industrial machinery with injected anomalies (drifts, spikes, and correlated failures).

## Dataset Summary
- **Sensors:** Vibrations, Temperature, Pressure, RPM, Flow Rate.
- **Duration:** 12 months (sampled at 1Hz).
- **Labels:** Normal, Point Anomaly, Collective Anomaly, Contextual Anomaly.

## Rationale
Enables robust testing of AI agents designed to handle multi-variate telemetry in manufacturing and industrial sectors.
